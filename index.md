### CPSC 120

* Lab 3 Part 2
Lab 3, part 2 was fun because I programmed a unit conversion tool. Instead
of googling the conversions, I am able to use the program I created to help 
me find the conversion which is awesome!

* Lab 9 Part 1
Lab 9, part 1 was a favorite because I didnâ€™t have to do any math if I wanted
to average numbers out. I just had to put the different numbers in the program
and it would do it automatically for me.

* Lab 11 Part 2
Lab 11, part 2 was another favorite because it was more difficult that the other
HiLo game we programmed. This is also a little fun game to play whenever you are bored.
